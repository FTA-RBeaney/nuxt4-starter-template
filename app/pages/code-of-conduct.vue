        Downtown Jazz Jam aims to provide a safe(r) and comfortable event
        experience for everyone, therefore all attendees, inspirers, staff, and
        volunteers at Downtown Jazz Jam are required to comply with the
        following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this Code throughout
        the event and we expect your full cooperation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What we stand for</strong></p>
      <p>
        Downtown Jazz Jam aims to provide a more welcoming, comfortable and
        safe(r) space for everyone, regardless of ethnic background, age, gender
        identity, sexual orientation, religion (or lack thereof), nationality,
        physical appearance, (dis)ability, dance experience, dance role or
        others. We welcome a diverse group of people and ideas. We don’t
        tolerate the intolerant.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not tolerate harassment in any form, nor do we permit the support
        or promotion of actions, ideologies, governments, or organizations that
        violate fundamental human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event participants, crew and freelancers violating these rules may be
        sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion
        of the organisers. We brief our inspirers about working with dancers of
        different ages, levels and bodies, and encourage them to develop
        inclusive teaching methods.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Need help?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Email info@downtownjazzjam.uk or find an organiser in person at any
        venue during the event.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Safe(r) Space Team</strong></p>
      <p>
        For the Downtown Jazz Jam 2025 we have a Safe(r) Space Team. You can
        contact any staff member, but these people are carefully selected to
        address any safe space policy issue, feedback or report. We’ll
        communicate our Safer Space team before the festival starts.
      </p>
      <p><strong>To get more understanding on the Code of Conduct</strong></p>
      <p>
        We do not tolerate harassment of anyone and in any form. Harassment
        includes offensive (non)verbal behaviour related to gender identity,
        age, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, physical appearance, skin color,
        religion, ethnicity, culture or any other expression of a person’s
        identity or background. We do not tolerate unwanted sexual images in
        public spaces or through other channels. We do not tolerate deliberate
        intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
        sustained disruption of workshops or other events, inappropriate
        physical contact and unwelcome (sexual) attention.
      </p>
      <p>We expect participants to follow these rules.</p>
      <p>
        If someone engages in any harassing behaviour, the event organisers may
        take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
        expulsion from the event with no refund. If necessary we will inform
        authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed, if you notice that someone else is being
        harassed, or if you have any other concerns, please contact a member of
        event staff immediately. Event staff can be found at any venue or
        location. Preferably contact anyone from the Safe(r) Space Team. You
        will find their photos, phone numbers and other means of contact posted
        at the event’s venues. You can also email to
        <a href="mailto:info@downtownjazzjam.uk">info@downtownjazzjam.uk</a>. We
        are aware that it is not easy to speak up but it will help us create a
        safe(r) environment for all of us. Designated crew members will always
        listen and assist those experiencing or witnessing harassment to feel
        safe(r) during our event, provide escort and support and help with
        notifying the authorities. We value your attendance and your safety.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
      <p><strong>YES, we appreciate this!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Here are some good practices that will hopefully ensure everybody’s
        comfort and wellbeing during our event.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We believe we all create the atmosphere, the vibe and the community we
          like to spend time in to dance and socialise. The way you hold space
          influences how the space will be shaped. If you want to appreciate a
          specific behaviour at the event, act as its first example.
        </li>
        <li>Act inclusively and nicely to everyone.</li>
        <li>Respect people around you and yourself.</li>
        <li>
          Remember that boundaries may differ from one person to another. Set
          good intentions and be clear in communication. If you aren’t sure
          about something, ask. If something doesn’t feel right – speak up. Our
          designated staff will be available in case you need support.
        </li>
      </ul>

        >
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Connect with partners the way it feels comfortable for both of you. If
          your partner uses a hurtful or inappropriate connection consistently,
          please let them know, they may not be aware of that.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask for people’s pronouns and share yours. Address people by their
          pronouns of choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask people if they want to follow, lead or switch. Share upfront what
          you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid giving unsolicited feedback. Do not correct others dancing
          unless you were specifically asked to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mind people around you. Accidentally kicked someone on the dancefloor?
          Apologise and check if they are ok. Avoid aerials or flash moves in
          social dancing, keep them for jams, shows and competitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          You unintentionally touched someone’s private areas? Apologise.If
          someone is repeatedly inappropriately touching you, bring it to their
          attention or the attention of our staff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be mindful when drinking alcohol or using other substances. If you are
          not sober and therefore pose a risk to yourself or others, leave the
          dance floor and ask for support.
        </li>
        <li>
          Want to dance with someone? Take initiative and invite them politely.
          Be mindful to take initiative to invite those who could benefit from
          your proactivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everybody has the right to say no to a dance, without need to justify
          it. If you say no, do it politely. If someone refuses to dance with
          you, don’t take it personally as there are lots of possible reasons.
          Like the need for a break, hurt ankle, disliked song, just not feeling
          it and many more.
        </li>
      </ul>
